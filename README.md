# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains two machine learning projects, each focusing on different aspects of predictive modeling.

## Project 1: Regression Analysis

The first project applies multiple machine learning algorithms to perform regression analysis. The primary goal is to predict a continuous target variable using the following techniques:

- **Linear Regression (LR)**: A basic but powerful method for linear modeling.
- **Random Forest (RF)**: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN)**: A type of artificial neural network suitable for learning complex non-linear relationships in the data.

## Project 2: Image Classification using CNN

The second project focuses on a classification task, specifically using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images. CNNs are particularly effective for image recognition and processing tasks.
